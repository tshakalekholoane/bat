NAME
    bat -- battery management utility for Linux laptops

SYNOPSIS

        [--debug] [--help] [--version]
        <command> [<arg>]

OPTIONS

        Display this help document and exit.

    --version

COMMANDS
    capacity
        Print the current battery level.

    health
        Print the battery health status.

    persist
        Persist the current threshold between restarts.

    reset
        Undoes the persistence setting of the charging threshold between
        restarts.

    status
        Print the charging status.

    threshold num
        Print the current charging threshold limit.

        If num is specified--which should be a value between 1 and 100--this
        will set a new charging threshold limit.

EXAMPLES
    - Print the current battery charging threshold.

        $ bat threshold

    - Set a charging threshold that will stop charging at 80%%. This requires
      superuser permissions.

        $ sudo bat threshold 80

    - Persist the current charging threshold setting between restarts. This also
      requires superuser permissions.

        $ sudo bat persist
