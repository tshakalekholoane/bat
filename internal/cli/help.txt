    - Print the current battery charging threshold.

        $ bat threshold
    
    - Set a charging threshold that will stop charging at 80%. This requires
      superuser permissions.

        $ sudo bat threshold 80
    
    - Persist the current charging threshold setting between restarts. This also
      requires superuser permissions.

        $ sudo bat persist
